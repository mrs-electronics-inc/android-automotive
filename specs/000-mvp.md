# MVP

This spec outline the goals for the MVP.

It will most likely require both operating system and application development.

## Task List

### Visualize CAN Data

- [ ] Implement basic VHAL (Vehical Hardware Abstraction Layer) to get data from CAN for the following:
  - [ ] Vehicle speed
  - [ ] Selected gear
  - [ ] EV battery level
- [ ] Ideally, implement some configuration system where we can use a config file to specify the mapping of CAN messages to VHAL attributes instead of hardcoding it
- [ ] Implement basic gauge cluster interface that displays the values from CAN in a pleasing fashion

### Camera Streaming

- [ ] Implement necessary logic to get data from connected camera
- [ ] Implement UI to allow user to view camera stream
- [ ] Ideally, use any built-in interfaces Android Automotive has for cameras

### Navigation App

- [ ] Include some sort of navigation app
- [ ] Ideally, include Google Maps app
  - [ ] We might need some sort of license from Google to include this
